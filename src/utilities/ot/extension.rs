//! Extension protocol.
//!
//! This file implements an Oblivious Transfer Extension (OTE) that realizes
//! Functionality 3 in `DKLs19` (<https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/523.pdf>). It is
//! used for the multiplication protocol (see multiplication.rs).
//!
//! As `DKLs23` suggested, we use Roy's `SoftSpokenOT` (<https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/192.pdf>).
//! However, we do not follow this paper directly. Instead, we use the `KOS` paper
//! available at <https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/546.pdf>. In the corrected version,
//! they present an alternative for their original protocol (which was used by `DKLs`,
//! but was not as secure as expected) using `SoftSpokenOT` (see Fig. 10 in `KOS`).
//!
//! In order to reduce the round count, we apply the Fiat-Shamir heuristic, as `DKLs23`
//! instructs. We also include an additional step in the protocol given by `KOS`. It
//! comes from Protocol 9 of the `DKLs18` paper (<https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/499.pdf>).
//! It is needed to transform the outputs to the desired form.
//!
//! # Remark: the OT width
//!
//! We implement the "forced-reuse" technique suggested in `DKLs23`.
//! As they say: "Alice performs the steps of the protocol for each input in
//! her vector, but uses a single batch of Bob’s OT instances for all of them,
//! concatenating the corresponding OT payloads to form one batch of payloads
//! with lengths proportionate to her input vector length."
//!
//! Actually, this approach is implicitly used in `DKLs19`. This can be seen,
//! for example, in the two following implementations:
//!
//! <https://github.com/coinbase/kryptology/blob/master/pkg/ot/extension/kos/kos.go>
//!
//! <https://github.com/docknetwork/crypto/blob/main/oblivious_transfer/src/ot_extensions/kos_ote.rs>
//!
//! In both of them, the sender supplies a vector of 2-tuples of correlations against
//! a unique vector of choice bits by the receiver. This number "2" is called in the
//! first implementation as the "OT width". We shall use the same terminology. Here,
//! instead of taking a vector of k-tuples of correlations, we equivalently deal with
//! k vectors of single correlations, where k is the OT width.
