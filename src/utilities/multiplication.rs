//! Random Vector OLE functionality from `DKLs23`.
//!
//! This file realizes Functionality 3.5 in `DKLs23` (<https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/765.pdf>).
//! It is based upon the OT extension protocol [here](super::ot::extension).
//!
//! As `DKLs23` suggested, we use Protocol 1 of `DKLs19` (<https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/523.pdf>).
//! The first paper also gives some orientations on how to implement the protocol
//! in only two-rounds (see page 8 and Section 5.1) which we adopt here.
